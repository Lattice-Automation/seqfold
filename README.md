# seqfold

Predict the minimum free energy structure of nucleic acids.

`seqfold` is an implementation of the `Zuker, 1981` dynamic programming algorithm, the basis for [UNAFold](http://unafold.rna.albany.edu/?q=DINAMelt/software)/[mfold](https://www.ibridgenetwork.org/#!/profiles/1045554571442/innovations/1/), plus energy functions from `SantaLucia, 2004`.

## Installation

```bash
pip install seqfold
```

## Usage

Python

```python
from seqfold import calc_dg

# a bifurcated DNA structure
calc_dg("GGGAGGTCGTTACATCTGGGTAACACCGGTACTGATCCGGTGACCTCCC")  # -12.94
```

CLI

```bash
$ seqfold TAGCTCAGCTGGGAGAGCGCCTGCTTTGCACGCAGGAGGT -t 32
-6.58
```

## Motivation

Knowing nucleic acid sequences' secondary structures is essential in synbio for selecting [primers for PCR](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/40/15/e115/1223759), designing [oligos for MAGE](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acssynbio.5b00219), and tuning [RBS expression rates](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123851208000024).

While [UNAFold](http://unafold.rna.albany.edu/?q=DINAMelt/software) and [mfold](https://www.ibridgenetwork.org/#!/profiles/1045554571442/innovations/1/) are the most widely used applications for nucleic acid secondary structure prediction, their format and license are restrictive. `seqfold` is meant to be a more open-source, but minimal, application for predicting minimum free energy secondary structure.

Framework for the dynamic programming approach. It has a conceptually helpful "Maximal Matching" example that demonstrates the approach on a simple sequence with only matched or unmatched bp.

The most cited paper in this space. Extends further than `Nussinov, 1980` with a nearest neighbor approach to energies and a consideration of each of stack, bulge, internal loop, and hairpin. Their data structure and traceback method are both more intuitive than `Nussinov, 1980`.

Zuker and colleagues expand on the 1981 paper to incorporate penalties for multibranched loops and dangling ends.

### SantaLucia, 2004

The paper from which almost every DNA energy function in `seqfold` comes from (with the exception of multibranch loops). Provides neighbor entropies and enthalpies for stacks, mismatching stacks, terminal stacks, and dangling stacks. Ditto for bulges, internal loops, and hairpins.

Source of RNA nearest neighbor change in entropy and enthalpy parameter data. In `/data`.

An investigation of energy functions for multibranch loops that validates the simple linear approach employed by `Jaeger, 1989` that keeps runtime at `O(nÂ³)`.
