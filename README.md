# seqfold

Predict the minimum free energy structure of nucleic acids.

`seqfold` is an implementation of the `Zuker, 1981` dynamic programming algorithm, that is the basis for [UNAFold](http://unafold.rna.albany.edu/?q=DINAMelt/software)/[mfold](https://www.ibridgenetwork.org/#!/profiles/1045554571442/innovations/1/), plus energy functions from `SantaLucia, 2004`.

```python
from seqfold import fold

# a triple-branch DNA structure
fold("GGGAGGTCGTTACATCTGGGTAACACCGGTACTGATCCGGTGACCTCCC")  # -10.9
```

## Motivation

Knowing about nucleic acid secondary structure is essential in synbio for selecting [primers for PCR](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/40/15/e115/1223759), designing [oligos for MAGE](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acssynbio.5b00219), and tuning [RBS expression rates](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123851208000024).

While [UNAFold](http://unafold.rna.albany.edu/?q=DINAMelt/software) and [mfold](https://www.ibridgenetwork.org/#!/profiles/1045554571442/innovations/1/) are the most widely used applications for nucleic acid secondary structure prediction, they have several limitations. Those and others are noted below.

## Citations

That papers and others that were used to develop this library are below. Each paper is listed along with how it relates to `seqfold`.

### Nussinov, 1980

Framework for the dynamic programming approach. It has a conceptually helpful "Maximal Matching" example that demonstrates the approach on a simple sequence with only matched or unmatched bp.

### Zuker, 1981

The most cited paper in this space. Extends further than `Nussinov, 1980` with a nearest neighbor approach to energies and a consideration of each of stack, bulge, internal loop, and hairpin. Their data structure and traceback method are both more intuitive than `Nussinov, 1980`.

### SantaLucia, 2004

The paper from which almost every DNA energy function in `seqfold` comes from (with the exception of multibranch loops). Provides neighbor entropies and enthalpies for stacks, mismatching stacks, terminal stacks, and dangling stacks. Ditto for bulges, internal loops, and hairpins.

An investigation of energy functions for multibranch loops that validates the simple linear approach employed by `Jaeger, 1989` that keeps runtime at `O(nÂ³)`.
